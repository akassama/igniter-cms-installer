## Getting Started

1. **Requirements:**

   - PHP 8.0 or higher
   - Composer
   - MySQL (or other supported database)
   - Web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.)
   - Enable `zip` and `gd` extension in php ini

2. **Steps:**

   - Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/akassama/igniter-cms` (Replace with your actual repo URL)
   - Navigate to the project folder: `cd igniter-cms`
   - Install dependencies: `composer install`
   - Configure Database Connection:
     - The database configuration is managed via a `.env` file. If you don't have one, create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.
     - Add the following database configuration settings to your `.env` file, replacing the placeholder values with your actual database credentials:
     ```
     database.default.hostname = localhost
     database.default.database = igniter_db
     database.default.username = root
     database.default.password =
     database.default.DBDriver = MySQLi
     database.default.DBPrefix =
     database.default.port = 3306
     ```
     - Also edit the database configuration in `app/Config/Database.php`:
     ```
     public array $default = [
         'DSN'     => '',
         'hostname' => ENVIRONMENT === 'production' ? 'prod_hostname' : 'localhost',
         'username' => ENVIRONMENT === 'production' ? 'prod_db_username' : 'root',
         'password' => ENVIRONMENT === 'production' ? 'prod_db_password' : '',
         'database' => ENVIRONMENT === 'production' ? 'prod_db' : 'igniter_db',
         'DBDriver' => 'MySQLi',
         // other settings
     ];
     ```
     Make sure to update the `hostname`, `username`, `password`, and `database` fields with your database connection details.
   - Create the Database: Using your database management system (e.g., PhpMyAdmin), create a new database with the same name specified in `Database.php`.
   - Set Up Base URL: Edit the configuration file located in `app/Config/App.php`:
   - Run migrations: `php spark migrate`. This command will execute all available migrations, creating the necessary database tables.
   - Delete Tables: if you want to clear all tables from the database, run the command `php spark delete:tables` and type `yes`.
   - Start the Application
     Ensure that your local server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) is running, then navigate to the base URL you set earlier:

   ```
   https://localhost/igniter-cms
   ```

   - Default Admin Login

     You can log in using the default Admin credentials:

     - Email: admin@example.com
     - Password: Admin@1

     To modify the default Admin login, go to the migration file located at `app/Database/Migrations/2024-08-27-210112_Users.php` and update the `$data[]` array accordingly.

3. **Permissions:** Ensure `writable` and `public/uploads` directories are writable by the web server.

4. **Email Configuration:** To enable email functionality, you need to configure your `EmailConfigType` in configurations (`account/admin/configurations`):
